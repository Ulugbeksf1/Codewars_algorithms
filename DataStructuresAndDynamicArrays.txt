Interface (AOI/ADT) vs Data structures
-specification
-what data you can store
-represantation 
- how to store
what the operations do
what operations are supported
what they mean
algorithms to support
2 main interfaces: 
problem statement
-solutions
2 main interfaces
-set
-sequence
2 main DS approaches
-arrays
-pointer based


1) static sequence interface: maintain a sequence of items x0, x1 .... xn-1 subject to these operations:

-get 
-set

Static array = Key:
